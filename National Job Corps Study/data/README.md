The National Job Corps Study (NJCS) is a nationwide evaluation of all the Job Corps centers in the mid-1990s. The analytic sample includes 14,125 youths who were targeted for the 48-month interview. It contains 8,818 respondents (3,491 control group members and 5,327 program group members) and 5,307 nonrespondents (2,235 control group members and 3,072 program group members). The mediator, collected at the 30-month follow-up, indicates whether a youth had obtained an education credential°™typically a General Educational Development (GED) certificate°™or a vocational certificate (or both) since the randomization. The outcome is weekly earnings in the fourth year after randomization. The data set also contains a sampling weight and 51 pretreatment covariates selected on theoretical grounds. We categorized all the continuous covariates to reduce the potential risk of misspecifying the functional form of a model. To preserve the probability sampling and the randomized experimental design, we create a missing indicator for each covariate with missing values. The site ID is not included because it is not publically available.

The analysis is implemented by the R package °∞MultisiteMediation°± (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MultisiteMediation).
