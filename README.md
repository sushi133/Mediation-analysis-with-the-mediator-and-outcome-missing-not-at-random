## Data

### Abstract 

This research analyzes medical claims data between 2003-2013 from the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System for children less than one year of age.  The information include the birthdate and location of each child and, in applicable, the time at which the child contracted bronchiolitis.  To ensure patient confidentiality, all dates and locations have been randomized to within a certain distance (the randomization amount is required to remain confidential) of the “true” date or location.

### Availability 

As per our contract with the Department of Defense, the data cannot be made publicly available because of the sensitivity of the information.

### Simulated data

The simulated data SimulatedCaseInfo.txt and SimulatedControlInfo.txt were both simulated using the posterior means of our model fit as the true parameters.  That is, we simulated (i) the number of children born according the a spatio-temporal point process with intensity Lambda in Section 2.2, (ii) simulated the number of cases according to the binomial model in Section 2.3 and (iii) jittered the data according to the jittering model described in Section 2.1.

## Code

This folder contains all necessary files to fit the binomial regression model with spatio-temporal uncertainty described in Heaton et al (2019).  The contents of this folder are as follows:

* ./ModelFitCode/FitBronchiolitisData.R: function for fitting the model
* ./Source/AMCMCUpdate.R: function that updates Metropolis proposal variances
* ./Data/CensusData.R: census information for each grid box in Norfolk VA
* ./Source/GetAdjMatrix.R: function for defining adjacency matrices
* ./Data/Norfolk200mgrid.Rdata: grid centroids for Norfolk VA at 200m level
* ./Data/NorfolkFullPredictionsPM25.Rdata: predictions and SE's of PM 2.5 at grid points in Norfolk
* ./DataNorfolkFullPredictionsSO2.Rdata: predictions and SE's of SO2 at grid points in Norfolk
* ./Data/SimulatedCaseInfo.txt: a simulated dataset of bronchiolitis cases in Norfolk VA
* ./Data/SimulatedControlInfo.txt: a simulated dataset of bronchiolitis controls in Norfolk VA
* README.md: README file containing instructions on how to run the code

FitBronchiolitisData.R is the main function for fitting the model.  This function uses the following libraries:

* LatticeKrig version 7.0
* data.table version 1.11.2
* parallel version 3.5.1
	
To run the code, the user will need to specify the following variables (all specified at the top of the file):

* t.jit.len - the temporal jittering length (in number of days)
* grid.box.len - the 1/2 size of the discretization grid of the spatial domain
* s.jit.len - the spatial jittering distance
* include.X.unc - if TRUE the model will include uncertainty in the pollution measurements in model fitting
* include.ST.unc - if TRUE the model will include spatio-temporal uncertainty in model fitting
* ncores.unc.update - if include.ST.unc=TRUE, the number of cores used to perform the sampling of true spatio-temporal locations
* ncores.param.update - number of cores used to calculate the likelihood of model parameters

Parallel processing is done via mclapply() from the parallel library.  Note that the mclapply() function is incompatible with Intel MKL libraries hence users will need to set MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 in the command line to take advantage of parallel processing.

FitBronchiolitisData.R requires approximately 20 minutes to prep the data by calculating overlap probabilities with the spatial grid cells (actual time depends on the size of the jittering lengths and number of observations) and calculate basis functions via eigendecompositions. After the initial spin up period, each iteration of the MCMC algorithm takes, approximately, 7 seconds using only a single core but gets as low as 2 seconds per iteration using 20 cores.
