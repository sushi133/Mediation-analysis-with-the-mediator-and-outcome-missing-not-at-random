### Abstract 

The data describes eligible applicants in the mid-1990s who lived in the areas selected for in-person interviews at the baseline. The subjects were randomized either to the experimental group where they could join the Job Corps program soon after randomization, or to the control group where they were not provided the Job Corps program for three years. The mediator was collected at the 30-months follow-up describing subject’s educational and vocational attainment, measured by whether or not the subject obtained an education credential or vocational certificate after randomization. The outcome was collected at the 48-months follow-up describing the subject’s weekly earnings in the fourth year after randomization. The measured covariates include information on gender, age, race, education level, earnings in the year before participating in the study, whether the subject had a child or not, and whether the subject had ever been arrested or not.
